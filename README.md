This application is a little bit unusual: it gives you information about a place whose coordinates you enter (you have to find coordinates elsewhere, such as by clicking on a place on Google Maps)

When you enter the coordinates of the place you are interested in, and you will receive the following:

1. A photo of the country of the nearest populated place to the place of your coordinates
2. The name of that nearest populated place
3. The name of that country
4. The distance of the nearest populated place from your coordinates
5. Current weather in that populated place

All the units are from the international metric system.
